- This project shows a basic slider function using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

- The user can view one of four images on the screen and move between them. All the image examples are available on public domain (ex: https://images.pexels.com/photos/4254553/pexels-photo-4254553.jpeg).

- Arrows and buttons allow the user to manage which image is exhibited on the screen. They function as pointers to control the image that is presented in the center of the user screen.

- Left and right arrows pointer to the previous and next image, respectively.

- When the user clicks on any arrow, it changes the image and also the buttons background color below the image. Current button background color is turned white and so the other buttons background colors are turned transparent.

- When clicked, the arrow or button change the image with one second (1s) transition effect.
