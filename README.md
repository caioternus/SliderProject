- This project shows a basic slider function using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

- The user can view one of four images on the screen and move between them. All the image examples are available on public domain (ex: https://images.pexels.com/photos/4254553/pexels-photo-4254553.jpeg).

- There are left and right arrows to navigate on the screen. The four buttons below them do the same.

- Left and right arrows pointer to the previous and next image, respectively.

- Arrows and buttons are pointers to control the image that is presented in the center of the user screen.

- Also, the current button background color is turned white and so the other buttons background colors are turned transparent.

- When clicked, the arrow or button change the image with one second transition effect.
