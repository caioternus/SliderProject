This project shows a basic slider function using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The user can view one of four images (available on public domain) on the screen and move between them.
There are left and right arrows to navigate on the screen, and four buttons below them.
Left and right arrows pointer to the previous and next image, respectively.
Arrows and buttons are pointers to control the image that is presented in the center of the user screen.
Also, the current button background color is turned white and so the other buttons background colors are turned transparent.
When clicked, the arrow or button change the image with one second transition effect.
